About
--------

I'm a software engineer with a track record of
leading software teams and leveraging data at scale.

I can offer deep expertise in large scale software architecture,
machine learning (ML) systems, deep learning with large,
noisy datasets and managing software engineering teams.

At Manulife, I built machine learning & AI systems
for quantitative investing in the capital markets, using
a diverse range of methods from natural language processing (NLP),
search, information extraction and bayesian inference.

I spent 6 years in academia as a hybrid scientist-engineer
working on autonomous robot fleets and drones. I published
original research in machine learning, built engineering prototypes,
and commercialised scientific research.

I once tried starting a cloud deep learning startup,
and was the first data science hire at a series-A startup in
the logistics / inventory management industry.
